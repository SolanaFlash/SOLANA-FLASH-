Sometimes we are asked about how does software work, itâ€™s very hard for non-developer people to understand how can a software do transactions.

In simply words the software remotely uses our wallets that are stored on our servers ðŸ™‚

Letâ€™s break it down little bit 

The backend of the .exe operates as a bridge between the client and a server-hosted cryptocurrency wallet, leveraging Web3.js for blockchain interactions.
 1. Server-Hosted Wallet: The walletâ€™s private keys are securely stored on the server using encrypted key management systems (e.g., AWS KMS). Private keys never leave the server, ensuring client-side security.

 2. Transaction Workflow:
The .exe sends transaction details (e.g., recipient, amount) to the server over a secure HTTPS connection. The server signs the transaction using the walletâ€™s private key. The signed transaction is broadcast to the blockchain via a connected Ethereum node (Infura).


 3. Security & API: All API calls are authenticated with JWT tokens and verified for integrity. Robust measures like rate limiting, firewalls, and encrypted storage ensure high security. Tracking & Logs: The server logs transaction metadata (timestamps, hashes) in a database (PostgreSQL) for tracking and audits.
